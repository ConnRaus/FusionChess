# Fusion Chess

Fusion Chess is a chess variation created by me learn QT C++. In this version, players have the ability to combine pieces to create new, more powerful ones with unique movements and strategies.

- **Piece Fusion Mechanics**: 
  Any piece on the board, except the king, can combine with another piece to form a new hybrid piece.
  - For example: A knight and a bishop can combine to create a piece that moves like both a knight and a bishop.

- **Fusion Rules**: 
  - A combination is only valid if it creates a new piece with unique moves. 
  - Combinations that would just result in a piece with the same moves, such as a queen and bishop combining to form a piece that moves like a queen, are disallowed.
